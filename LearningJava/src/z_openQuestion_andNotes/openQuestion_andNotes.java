    OPEN QUESTIONS
	- is there any meaning changing datatype from String to int/float/double as well? if yes how to do it ?
	ANSWER:  sometime number are quoted inside " ", at that time this typecasting is useful  
	- Are "for loops, while loop and do while loop" same?  Is there any problem which one can solve but other cannot?  
		Asking this because I think studying any one of this is enough. ANSWER:  they all are same 

	
	
	USEFUL NOTE
	1. noted for single and multiple line comment and to comment multiple lines: select then ctrl + /
	2. short cut to run code ctrl+F11
	3. type sysout and hit ctrl+space to get system.out.println() then press Ennter key
	4. To debug a code:  
		double click on the left scroll bar (not right, its left scroll bar) next to the line number 
		where you want the debug process to start.  then you can see a blue dot there, which is called BREAK-POINT.
		From the menu bar click on Run >> Debug  (alternatively click on F11)  
		this start the debug process and you will see a blue highlight on the code which is being executed along with 
		its result on console (immediate previous line result will populate in console).
		click on Run > Step Over to move to next line of code.
	5. use the above process to run some part of code
